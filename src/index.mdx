## Update Radio Setting

Edit the file at **/opt/ifs/packet_forwarder/lora_pkt_fwd/global_conf.json**

The gateway has 8 channels. The Radio 0 and 1 is the central frequency. The frequency of each channels needs to specify positive and negative adjustment depending on the frequency of the radio.

For example:

1. open `global_conf.json` and adjust the field `if` of the radio accordingly.

```json
"chan_multiSF_0": {
  "desc": "Lora MAC, 125kHz, all SF, 920.9MHz",
  "enable": true,
  "radio": 0,
  "if": -400000
}
```

2. Restart `packet-forwarder` service after modification of configuration file.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart packet-forwarder
```
